class="headerlink" title="概述"></a>概述</h2><p>《牺牲》是安德烈·塔可夫斯基在1986年死于肺癌前的最后一部作品。影片的背景设置在瑞典的一个沿海小村庄中，围绕一个大的家庭住宅展开。电视广播报道了即将到来的核战争。在经历似乎十分漫长的精神危机中，大学教授、退休演员和家里边的父亲亚历山大急切地向上帝祈祷，寻求帮助。如果神的干预可以避免核灾难，他承诺牺牲自己所有的世俗联系。亚历山大的朋友奥托是当地的邮递员，他自称是无法解释的事件的收集者，并指示亚历山大与住在村子里的神秘的家仆玛丽亚交媾。奥托告诉他，玛丽亚是“至善”的女巫，并且可以帮助到他。在拜访玛丽亚之后的第二天早上，亚历山大在家中醒来，发现一切都很平静。亚历山大意识到核战争已经被阻止，于是他引诱他的家人出门晨走，这样他就可以履行他给上帝的承诺。影片的最后一幕是亚历山大在家人回来之前点燃了家里的房子，接着被救护车带走。</p><p>同塔可夫斯基之前的许多作品一样，《牺牲》是一部探讨当代生活中的信仰危机和人对精神的追求的电影。其诗意、令人着迷的美和特有的晦涩难懂的叙事给予了观众各种不同的解释可能。就我而言，我认为这部电影的核心是在一个理性、技术发展和地缘政治战争的时代当中对于信仰危机的探索。对这种解释以及对电影中广博的哲学思想的分析超出了本文的范围。我们在此关心的是声音——它具有强大的联想性同时又从内而发地模棱两可和难以捉摸——如何被塔可夫斯基用来表达一种来自“彼岸世界”的感受：自然与精神的难以言喻的神秘性。正是声音的这种特性和功能让它神奇地唤起了超越物质秩序的“彼岸世界”的情绪。我们发现这种对于声音的运用是塔可夫斯基所有电影中的重要的风格和理念。正是由于这个原因，我选择了《牺牲》来作为我对声音模糊性探索的纽带。</p><h2 id="声音后期制作"><a href="#声音后期制作" class="headerlink" title="声音后期制作"></a>声音后期制作</h2><p>《牺牲》的配音由瑞典声音设计师兼混音师 Owe Svensson 在录音室中创作。所有的对话都在后期制作中以ADR (Automated Dialogue Replacement，对白重置)重新录制，由演员重新完成。拟音元素——脚步声， movements and surface noises – were recorded by Svensson in the studio and his country house. For the sound effects Tarkovsky provided a list of some 250 sounds which Svensson sourced from published library recordings. These sounds, together with the foley and dialogue recordings were treated with effects and equalisation where needed and mixed together according to Tarkovsky’s specific direction to form the completed soundtrack. Tarkovsky himself had his own particular approach to the practical as well as aesthetic treatment of film sound. An approach which remained fairly consistent throughout all his work. Tarkovsky preferred to concentrate on the image alone when shooting leaving Svensson to deal with the sound later in post-production.</p><p>By dismissing production sound altogether, Tarkovsky eliminated the possibility of sound interfering with the visual composition of the film, not to mention complicating the practical arrangements of any given setup. In doing so he was free to concentrate his efforts on working with the camera. This allowed him to capture sequences of action which, if he was using location sound recording, might prove problematic. An example of this are the many dialogue sequences in The Sacrifice which are presented in wide-shot, observing the characters from distance - a kind of visual composition akin to theatre. Conventionally the boom microphone would be positioned outside the frame, behind or along side the camera. This would capture all sounds from the visual perspective of the camera, responding naturally to the acoustic effects of the space and the position of the actors within. For greater clarity at such distances sound recordists would tend to use radio microphones pinned to the actors clothes, or conceal microphones in the room behind objects or furniture. Tarkovsky told Svensson early on that his principle during filming of The Sacrifice was that “his focus was always on the picture while the sound comes later”<a href="#19">[19]</a>. In ignoring production sound, Tarkovsky committed himself to a complete re-rendering of all dialogue in post-production. Despite the challenges of capturing the correct performances in ADR, it did afford Svensson and Tarkovsky a greater degree of control over how they would treat the voices in post-production. This allowed them to treat the dialogue naturalistically, creating a convincing impression of the voices emanating from the space and responding to the actors movements. Or, to treat the dialogue in a more stylistic manner that would remove it from the space.</p><p>Throughout much of his film work, Tarkovsky makes extensive use of the space beyond the frame of the camera. These sounds often function to create a greater sense of place, allowing the director to create an expansive world that stretches out beyond the immediate environment of the characters onscreen. Often these sounds are not immediately recognisable, revealing themselves through their inherent morphology (e.g. overheard fighter jets) or through repetition over the course of the film (e.g. birds). Repeating such sounds allows Tarkovsky to setup an audiovisual logic unique to the world of the film. The ambiguity that is felt at the beginning becomes part of the language of the film that the audience is familiarised with over time.</p><p>In The Sacrifice Tarkovsky allows the peripheral offscreen world to impact upon the onscreen action. This is achieved through the careful use of sound. Specifically, this takes the form of vibrating (metallic) bodies onscreen. The revealing of these vibrations follows a specific audiovisual logic. First, we hear the vibrating sounds offscreen, that creates an uncertainty as to what the sounds are and where they are coming from. Next, the camera presents the vibrating objects, often slowly tracking round some other point in the space towards the objects. In the final phase, as the vibrating sounds continue, the actual sound event offscreen causing the vibrations is gradually revealed. These offscreen forces are often sounds with long attacks, that similarly confuse us as to their source and nature. Gradually they appear and we recognise them for what they are. The obvious example of this in The Sacrifice, are the fighter jets that fly overhead, causing the wine glasses in the room to vibrate. Another, more subtle use of external forces on local objects, is the ebb and flow of the wind that causes the panes of window glass in Little man’s room to bend and creak. The external world impacting upon the onscreen world is a technique made possible through sound. It is something we find in Tarkovsky’s other films, notably at the very beginning of Stalker where the bedside tray vibrates as the train outside passes by.</p><h2 id="声音：简介"><a href="#声音：简介" class="headerlink" title="声音：简介"></a>声音：简介</h2><blockquote><p>It seemed…that her voice sounded quite different in the silvery blue of the night…loud, clear and gentle, it had, as it were, arches and curves; he believed he could see the voice and almost catch hold of it. Soon he had the sensation that it made an arch over his head and that he was standing directly beneath it.<a href="#20">[20]</a></p></blockquote><p>Throughout <em>The Sacrifice</em> we hear a female voice calling from the distance. It is a repetitive, playfully melodic call, not too dissimilar to a kind of yodeling that wildly rises and falls in pitch. Almost like the mimicry of some kind of bird song. The physical location of this woman is never made exactly clear in the film, but the voice’s particular timbre and quality of reverberence suggests that it is emanating from some distance away, somewhere in the offscreen space. A Swedish audience might recognise this kind of voice and identify it as that of a woman herding sheep or cows, that are grazing across the fields that surround the family house. Nothing is certain though, nothing is made visible. And so throughout the film the actual origin of the voice is shrouded in mystery; its material form restricted to speculation.</p><h2 id="声音：跨越时空"><a href="#声音：跨越时空" class="headerlink" title="声音：跨越时空"></a>声音：跨越时空</h2><p>The ambiguity of the voice is heightened when the film moves from the reality of the narrative in the present tense to the dream or apocalyptic vision space of Alexander. As in The Mirror (1975), Tarkovsky underlines such shifts by changing the image from colour to black and white. This helps cue our awareness of a new space, governed perhaps by different laws and functioning in a different way. Having situated the voice within a particular space, we might suspect that the woman’s voice would become inaudible the moment the geography of the film is changed. However in many significant sequences throughout film this does not happen. Instead the voice is heard as a kind of sonic transition between the two worlds, continuing unchanged in the new space. We first hear this at the beginning of the film after Alexander’s monologue underneath the trees.</p><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/05/ke1dYxqtcOKXFmb.png" alt="The woman&#39;s voice is first heard outside during Alexander&#39;s opening monologue. After his sudden collapse, the scene changes to the dilapated courtyard. All the while the voice continues sounding. Still from *The Sacrifice* (1986) "></p><p>The woman’s voice is introduced as a part of the natural countryside soundscape. A voice that some might suspect is herd-calling. We detect it from far off in the distance. Its angelic, free-flight quality attracts our attention but we find nothing out of the ordinary with it. Little Man, Alexander’s son, jumps out and surprises his father causing him to collapse and enter into what seems like an apocalyptic vision or dream. With a crash of thunder and an eerily sustained rumble, the scene suddenly changes. We are now looking at a black and white image of a brick tunnel flanked by two staircases that opens out on to a dilapidated courtyard. We continue to hear the low rumble of the thunder together with the woman’s voice as the camera slowly pans down. Suddenly there are doubts about our previous assertions concerning the material presence of the voice in the countryside. This new sound-image juxtaposition suggests the voice has moved from the diegetic to the non-diegetic acoustic space. Through such a transformation the voice becomes imbued with a magic that permits it to move seamlessly across time and space, a pattern that will reoccur in other parts of the film. This grants the voice a kind of omnipotence, lying somewhere between the objective plain of the world and the subjective space of Alexander’s mind. 女人的声音作为自然乡村音景的一部分被引入。一些人可能怀疑的声音是羊群召唤。我们从远处探测到它。它天使般的自由飞行品质吸引了我们的注意力，但我们并没有发现它有什么不寻常的地方。亚历山大的儿子小人跳了出来，吓到他的父亲，使他倒下并进入了一个世界末日的景象或梦境。伴随着一声惊雷和持续不断的隆隆声，场景突然发生了变化。我们现在看到的是一个黑白图像，一条砖砌隧道的两侧是两个楼梯，通向一个破旧的庭院。随着摄像机慢慢向下平移，我们继续听到低沉的雷声和女人的声音。突然间，人们对我们之前关于农村声音的物质存在的断言产生了怀疑。这种新的声像并置表明声音已经从叙事空间转移到非叙事声学空间。通过这样的转变，声音变得充满了魔力，使其能够在时间和空间中无缝移动，这种模式将在电影的其他部分再次出现。这赋予了声音一种无所不能的感觉，介于世界的客观平原和亚历山大头脑的主观空间之间。</p><h2 id="声音：聆听角度"><a href="#声音：聆听角度" class="headerlink" title="声音：聆听角度"></a>声音：聆听角度</h2><p>Doubts about what we see and hear occur frequently in The Sacrifice. The constant shifting of the voice between the diegetic and non-diegetic space provides clues as to who could be hearing what and any particular time. In the dream sequences in which the voice feels clearly non-diegetic we assume that the voice is functioning more as abstract sound/music outside the hearing of any one character. But if we consider the dream sequences from Alexander’s perspective - as his dream, his sound world - then the voice may become more immanent and private to just him. We notice that the voice is only ever present in sequences of the film which feature either Alexander alone or Alexander with Otto. Perhaps Otto, in being in touch with the more supernatural elements is also in touch with Alexander’s subconscious stirrings. His aches, pains, hopes and faith.</p><p>In the diegetic realm we are led to believe that all characters within the story can hear the voice. But the prevalence of the voice as a natural part of the soundscape doesn’t draw any notable attention from anyone. And yet, there are three important instances where Otto and Alexander become visibly aware of the voice. The first take places just after Otto has finished telling the family a strange tale about a woman and her son. As he walks towards the window the offscreen voice of the woman is heard. Soon after this sound Otto falls to the ground. The impression one has in this sequence is that the voice seemingly causes Otto to fall down. The second occasion happens during the dream sequence in Alexander’s house when Otto instructs Alexander that he go and lie with Maria. As the two men sit talking in a nervous whisper, the distant voice of a woman is heard by Otto. He asks Alexander if he heard anything. Alexander replies no. Was it only Otto who heard the voice? Why not Alexander? The third occasion occurs when Alexander leaves the house, riding Otto’s bicycle across the deserted countryside. As he passes along the lane he falls off the bicycle. He gets up, perhaps realizing the absurdity of his actions and turns round as if to give up.</p><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/05/NXW2HPGw6amFysq.png" alt="Hearing the voice: Two instances. [Left] On his way to Maria&#39;s house Alexander falls from his bicycle. Disgruntled and tired, he turns round and decides to give up and return home. Suddenly the voice of woman echoing across the fields is heard. He stops to listen. [Right] Otto suddenly hears a distant voice. He asks Alexander if he heard it. He replies that he heard nothing. Still from *The Sacrifice* (1986)"></p><p>Suddenly he stops. The distant sound of a woman’s voice echoes across the land. It seems to be speaking to Alexander, or at the very least he is achknowledging its presence. Is it asking him to reconsider giving up? That despite all obstacles – the land, the laws of the physical world, the apparent irrationality of what he thinks his actions can achieve – he must continue onwards to Maria and their union. Only through faith in such union can he and the world be saved. Is the voice actually sounding from within the landscape? If not is it a voice inside Alexander’s head that we the audience are involuntarily eavesdropping on? Or, is the voice simply a sonic metaphor for man’s faith, his desperate longing for hope in an impersonal world? This kind of trickery where the origin of sounds and the listening spaces they inhabit are manipulated forms a central part of the film’s audiovisual language. This is perhaps most acutely represented in the enigmatic presence of the woman’s voice.</p><h2 id="声音：两个世界之间"><a href="#声音：两个世界之间" class="headerlink" title="声音：两个世界之间"></a>声音：两个世界之间</h2><p>The equivocal quality of the voice in The Sacrifice is not new. Its very much part of a storytelling tradition in which the presence of disembodied voices is used to express the emotional narrative of a character. This commonly serves to render a character’s psychological state intelligible to an audience by externalizing her thoughts, memories, reveries, longings, angst, troubles and confusions. In cinema perhaps the most obvious use of the voice in this sense is the voice-over; a device that grants us access to the private thoughts that make up a character’s internal monologue. Another common use is the all-seeing, omnipresent voice of a narrator; an objective voice outside of the film, or possibly the voice of a character involved in the story.</p><p>There is however, yet another, more enigmatic use of the voice in film that lingers in the region between the subjective space of the mind and the external, objective world. An unsettling place of confusion, disbelief, hallucination and mental trickery. Where individual control becomes vulnerable to the influence of outside forces. Where all personal experience is cast into doubt. All may not be what it seems: “Inexplicable, but true”. This discomfort has been richly mined throughout the world through tales of ghosts, haunted houses, phantom spirits and the supernatural.</p><p>Evolution has sensitized human beings to respond to sounds that cannot be easily identified. The fear that we might experience under such conditions has been creatively exploited in film. Nowhere is this carried out more with such precision than in horror films. From the start, the very positioning of the audience outside of the film world observing the emotional narrative of a character setups an ambiguity of the senses. This is particularly the case in response to sound phenomena, where the physical presence of a sound-source is visually concealed. Under such conditions the audible presence of a disembodied voice can lead to questions concerning its point of origin: Is it a mental voice inside the head of a character? Is it an actual voice in the environment outside the character? Or is it neither, but rather a metaphoric expression of mood between the emotions of the character and the atmosphere of place?</p><p>One of my favourite British films is Jack Clayton’s fantastically atmospheric horror The Innocents from 1961. One night while quietly reading next to the fire Miss Giddens, the newly appointed governess, begins to hear strange voices from somewhere. Her curiosity beckons her to the stairs which she slowly ascends. As she climbs up, step by step, forward along the corridor, the voices intensify into a cacophonic whirlwind of whispers, hysteric laughter and shouts. The beginning of this sequence places the voices, quite naturalistically, somewhere within the physical space of the house. But as the tension in the scene slowly increases, a dramatic crescendo of sound is reached. The kind of extreme layering and treatment of sound heard here feels more a part of the expressionist language and atmosphere of the film then anything naturalistic. This sequence illustrates the ambiguity of the voice in how it is used. Could these offscreen voices actually be emanating from inside the house? Or are they the voices in her head? A voice of secrets, mystery, horrors of the past forcing their way into Miss Giddens’ conscious awareness and crippling her with mental anguish. Perhaps they are neither of these, but something closer to a sense of dark atmosphere that inhabits the house.</p><p>The woman’s voice in The Sacrifice similarly occupies a place between Alexander’s mind and the world around him. This raises questions concerning the auditory experience of him and the film’s characters. Who is hearing what? Is it of reality or of something else? Could Alexander be experiencing the woman’s voice as an ongoing auditory hallucination? Alexander’s string of visions and dreams suggests a singular subjective journey of one character throughout the film. This support the theory that what we hear in the soundtrack might actually be part of his own hallucination. A purely subjective perspective. At the beginning of his book Hallucinations neurologist Oliver Sacks discusses the difficulty in defining what a hallucination is:</p><blockquote><p>Precise definitions of the word ‘hallucination’ still vary considerably, chiefly because it is not always easy to discern where the boundary lies between hallucination, misperception, and illusion. But generally, hallucinations are defined as precepts arising in the absence of any external reality - seeing things or hearing things that are not there.<a href="#21">[21]</a></p></blockquote><p>The consistent spatio-temporal ambiguity of the woman’s voice suggests in Alexander a crossing of boundaries between hallucination, misperception and illusion. This complexity is intensified during Alexander’s apocalyptic visions when the voice becomes a kind of musical accompaniment - not merely an article of hallucination but material that is part of the very fabric of the world and his mind.</p><h2 id="声音：启示录"><a href="#声音：启示录" class="headerlink" title="声音：启示录"></a>声音：启示录</h2><p>Owe Svensson, the man credited with creating the film’s soundtrack, revealed in an interview that the woman’s voice was from an old wax cylinder recording of cow herding calls. These were treated with varying degrees of reverberation in post-production. Perhaps for Swedish viewers the woman’s voice was more easily recognisable as herd calling. For others it maintains more of its mystery. I believe the exact meaning of the voice in the film remains open to interpretation, though Svensson does provide an explanation worth mentioning here in full:</p><blockquote><p>The important thing was that there was this woman and she comes into the film quite early and then she enters the dream and that represents a connection with human emotions which of course [is] a contrast to the threat of war. Both Otto - the actor Allan Edwall - and Alexander are in contact with her Otto seems to receive her call when he suddenly collapses on the floor while walking through the house telling strange tales. One never really discovers what is going on. Somebody asked me long ago if this was a contact with God but I did not want to answer because I do not know - I do not think so.<a href="#22">[22]</a></p></blockquote><p>While it remains true that the source of the woman’s voice is never explicitly presented in the film – the visible presence of a woman (or women, for could it not also be the sound of different women at different times?) - Tarkovsky does provide us with a few clues concerning the voice. The first of these occurs during Alexander’s conversation with Otto outside at the beginning of the film. It is during these moments that we hear the sounds of cows, followed by the faint metallic rattling of cowbells.</p><p><img src="https://s2.loli.net/2023/07/05/vfCBLVJxlpAqXow.png" alt="Maria on her bicycle. In the background we notice the cows and the tiny figure of the cow herder. All the while we hear her voice in the soundtrack. Still from The Sacrifice (1986)"></p><p>Two hours later at the end of the film Tarkovsky returns to the same location. The loud burning of the house is suddenly muted as the scene changes to the idyllic countryside where we hear the the woman’s voice again. The scene cuts to Maria riding her bicycle and looking into the distance at the ambulance car slowly approaching. In the background we see for the first time the cows, and in amongst them a momentary glimpse of a single figure. It is this tiny figure that we assume is the cow herder and the source of the voice. And so it is that in the final few shots of the film Tarkovsky seemingly reveals the solitary body to which the voice belongs to: sound finally rendered visible; word made flesh and a return to the material world.</p><h2 id="自然：雷声、风声与水声"><a href="#自然：雷声、风声与水声" class="headerlink" title="自然：雷声、风声与水声"></a>自然：雷声、风声与水声</h2><blockquote><p>It was like wind, far away, but with a depth like a rumbling of the earth. Thinking that it might be in himself, a ringing in his ears, Shingo shook his head.<a href="#23">[23]</a></p></blockquote><p>In The Sacrifice the sound of low rumble, wind and water feature prominently. These sounds are used as components of the natural soundscape that the film is set in and as a sonic device to mark changes in time and space. Significantly, the low rumble of the thunder and the fighter jets passing overhead play an important role in transitioning between reality and Alexander’s vision states. In each case, an event first occurs, the clap of thunder or the screech of fighter jets that produces a low sustained rumble. This extended rumble (artificially treated in the studio) continues over the change in image from the colour space of reality to the black and white imagery of the vision, smoothly guiding the audience into the new space. In doing so it moves effortlessly from a recognisable element within the diegesis, to a dark rumbling drone that envelops the sound space. Its low-register tone helps to evoke a dark, forbidding atmosphere that feels in keeping with the apocalyptic imagery of the vision and Alexander’s mental angst. The movement of the sound from reality into vision very much mirrors a similar treatment of the woman’s voice. The result is a profound audiovisual experience in which the sustained sounds of the voice and rumble – one high, one low – juxtaposed with the slow panning. slow-motion black and white imagery come together to create an alluring otherworldly impression of civilisation’s destruction.</p><p>Wind is an elusive force of nature. It defines itself by the environment it comes into contact with; the shape of the land, the forest, bushes and vegetation. It is never really heard itself. Rather its audible impact on the surrounding environment is noticeable at different moments in the film. The wind blowing through the trees at the beginning of the film often reminds me of the remarkable wind captured blowing across the countryside in The Mirror (1975). Both evoke a feeling of man’s vulnerability in the face of the elements; his inherent weakness in the presence of such an impersonal and uncompromising force. And yet its sheer omnipotent power has filled men with an unshakeable feeling of sublime awe. Elsewhere in The Sacrifice the wind penetrates the interior of the family house. This is felt most clearly in Little Man’s room. Here Tarkovsky creates a quiet atmosphere of tranquility through the careful control of sound and light. Tiny audible creakings of the window pane motion in unison with the flickering of the sun’s light, as the curtains gently blow back and forth. This rhythmic movement of sound and light identifies Little Man’s room as a place of great calmness; a delicate sanctuary of peace and hope for the future.</p><p>Water is a consistent feature of Tarkovsky’s soundtracks. Especially trickling and dripping water (The Sacrifice, Nostalgia, Stalker). It is a life-giving force, always in motion like the flux of life, channeling through the arteries of dirt and vegetation and between the neglected, decaying artifacts of civilisation – coins, garments, boxes, guns. In The Sacrifice both trickling and dripping water feature at particular moments when we enter into Alexander’s visions. Similar to the way it is used in previous films, water is often first introduced in the soundtrack before it isrevealed with the camera. Momentarily devoid of visual verification, the dripping or trickling water sounds feel somewhat surreal, out of place and lead to a sense of disorientation concerning the geography of the scene. This is particularly the case during the first apocalyptic vision. Afterwards, such treatment of water is recognizable, and we become more familiar with the range of essential ingredients that make up Tarkovsky’s sonic palette.</p><h2 id="共振"><a href="#共振" class="headerlink" title="共振"></a>共振</h2><p>塔可夫斯基在整个生涯当中都喜好用可以共振的物体——金属、玻璃、瓷器、钟。这种可共振物体的声音可以形容为飘渺虚幻的。产生具有辨识度的音调的能力使这样的声音赋予上了某种意义；其所拥有的一种让场景展现出“彼岸世界”意味的韵律，从环境里的日常事物之中脱离出来。我们可能将这种共振的声音与仪式或是神圣的庆典联系起来；用钟声和锣声召唤神灵、祈祷和神圣仪式的神圣标记。</p><p>Perhaps one of the most well known sequences where these sounds are used, is when the fighter jets first pass over the house in The Sacrifice. As is common practice with Tarkovksy, we first hear the sound and then see it, thereby either confirming or denying our initial responses to how we think the world operates and by what laws. The gentle chiming of vibrating glass is first heard, followed by a low rumble rising in intensity. Julia, one of the house maids, is shown looking upwards, suggesting the sound is emanating from above, possibly chandeliers. The camera however objects, and instead gestures down to a reveal a tray of wine glasses rattling together. In Maria’s house, a similar array of vibrating bodies is first heard preempting the arrival of fighter jets flying above. The repetition of this phenomenon across the film sets up an association between the uncanny presence of vibrating objects (the artifacts of civilisation, or perhaps the jewellery of Western decadence) and the fighter jets that usher in nuclear war and the apocalyptic end of days. The sound of the fragile bodies of china, glass and metal come to signal that something (familiar) is about to happen.</p><p>Like leaves blowing in the wind, objects that vibrate are under the influence of a greater, invisible force - nature, pure energy. The effect is obvious but the cause less so. The first instance of the fighter jets is cloaked in momentary confusion. This is how I remember feeling the first time I saw the film. I impulsively retreated to what I knew - the threatening sound of an earthquake that I remembered from my life in Japan. Only later once the tail of the jet engine sound had reached my ears, did I register the slow creeping sensation of war and fear. This is life. Through the careful manipulation of sound and images, this also, is film. As Robert Bresson once said in an interview: “We must let the mystery remain. Life is mysterious, and we must see that on screen. The effects of things must always be shown before their causes, like in real life.” Tarkovksy was assuredly in command at mastering such mystery in his films.</p><h2 id="电话铃"><a href="#电话铃" class="headerlink" title="电话铃"></a>电话铃</h2><p>Finally let us briefly consider the engima of the ringing telephone at the end of The Sacrifice. The moment occurs during the dramatic house burning sequence as Alexander’s family return from their morning walk. Amidst the cacophonous roar of fire, crackling wood, breaking glass and shakuhachi music, suddenly the faint ringing sound of a telephone from inside the house is heard. No sooner do we recognise it as a telephone than it has quickly been consumed in the violence of the flames. Does this seemingly random sound event bear any significance on the end of the film? I believe it does. Like the birthday mail he receives at the beginning of the film, the telephone represents Alexander’s immediate (telecommunication) and historical connection to the social order; work, academia and his past life in the theatre. The ringing telephone in the fire is a symbolic aswell as literal event, that expresses the severing of ties between Alexander and his social and professional life. Retrospectively, the significance of this is all the more profound when we contrast it with how Alexander had earlier woken up and quite casually exchanged a few words with his colleague on the telephone before beginning final preparations for the fire. The audible telephone ringing represents the material world’s final, desperate attempt to bring Alexander back from the brink of self-annihilation.</p><h2 id="注释"><a href="#注释" class="headerlink" title="注释"></a>注释</h2><p><span id="18">[18]</span>Andrei Tarkovksy.
